# Mean-Residue-Ellipticity
Convert CD millideg data to Mean Residue Ellipticity (MATLAB)
#      MRE =  CD signal * Mean Residue Weight
#            --------------------------------
#            10 * Protein Concentration * Pathlength
#  
# where
# CD signal in mdeg
# Mean Residue Weight (For proteins - 110)
# Protein Concentration in mg/ml
# Pathlength (0.1 or 1 cm)
# MRE UNIT - deg cm2 dmol-1
